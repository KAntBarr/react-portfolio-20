## Description
In this website, I present the completed projects with their summaries from the UC Berkeley Full Stack Coding Bootcamp and Sacramento State University. There are links to other pages such as: "About Me", "Contact Me", and "Resume". The "About Me" page will give an introduction of me, Koby, and a summary of my learning/experience, along with plans to further develop/grow for the future. The "Contact Me" page is not currently fully functional because there is no back-end functionality, but provides full front-end functionality. The last page will provide a way to view and/or download my last updated resume. Lastly, by clicking on a project in the portfolio page, a modal will appear showing a summary of the project.
